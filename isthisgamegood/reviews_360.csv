Got that Valve bundle a long ass time ago and this was just nestled into all the Half-Life block. Dude... Talk about a time machine!

I managed to find an active server and ran around having memories of a time gone by. I'm not that old but old enough to miss being stuck in a certain point in time and not fully understanding the gravity of growing up but also maybe a little too well. And you would think that this dusty, practically dead, relic of an FPS PVP would have elicited other emotions. Boredom, maybe, because the graphics are Minecraft in Standard Definition. Maybe anger at how janky and weirdly precision the guns feel to use. or even, still, a bland indifference. But no. I was back in the gaming cafe, with my buds, just focused on beating each other up and strangely happy about it. When I tell you I could almost taste the Monster, I'm not a paid ad! It's scary real it all felt. 

So I'm glad I stumbled into playing a bit of this. I dunno how good it was upon release or how popular it was to play. I was just getting into video games and wasn't deep in the culture yet, But one thing I do know is that it captures a certain era of my lifetime and I was cozily marinating in the memories.",1700223482,1700223482,True,17,3,0.690452277660369873,0,True,False,False,True,

Got that Valve bundle a long ass time ago and this was just nestled into all the Half-Life block. Dude... Talk about a time machine!

I managed to find an active server and ran around having memories of a time gone by. I'm not that old but old enough to miss being stuck in a certain point in time and not fully understanding the gravity of growing up but also maybe a little too well. And you would think that this dusty, practically dead, relic of an FPS PVP would have elicited other emotions. Boredom, maybe, because the graphics are Minecraft in Standard Definition. Maybe anger at how janky and weirdly precision the guns feel to use. or even, still, a bland indifference. But no. I was back in the gaming cafe, with my buds, just focused on beating each other up and strangely happy about it. When I tell you I could almost taste the Monster, I'm not a paid ad! It's scary real it all felt. 

So I'm glad I stumbled into playing a bit of this. I dunno how good it was upon release or how popular it was to play. I was just getting into video games and wasn't deep in the culture yet, But one thing I do know is that it captures a certain era of my lifetime and I was cozily marinating in the memories.",1700223482,1700223482,True,17,3,0.690452277660369873,0,True,False,False,True,
